<h2 style="font-family:didot";> Welcome!</h2>

<h1 title="is a website maintained by IQUESTIONEVERYONE;" style="background-image:url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TU6fpz7lbOA/maxresdefault.jpg);"> Hello World!</h1>
<p>Technology is improving at increasingly expotential rate. What was thought to be once impossible to do in fields such as medicine, is now possible in almost any shape or form.</p>

<hr>

<h3 style="font-family:didot;" ><b> Robots, to be specific</b></h3>
<p>Robots, for example are dominating the medical field with advancements like prosethetics, in space with the employment of rovers to explore distant celestial bodies, and with assembling a variety of foods for packaging to cars in factories.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:didot";> A common misconception about robots</h3>
<p style="font-family:futura"> Contrary to what most people believe, <i> robots are not always out to get us.</i><br>
They are not all terminators bent on the destruction of human kind; instead, only reflections of the needs and wants of their only creators.<br> 
If a robot or some form of artifical intelligence does rise up and create a revolution, it would need a reason.<br> 
If programmed like a human, it will act like one in the face of injustice... <br>
Which really says something about the <mark>morality</mark> of the very humans who created something close to human...</p>

<p><blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1796026-i-robot">
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br>
A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. <br>
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br>
</blockquote></p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:bodoni";> There are also other types of robots</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <pre>
     <li>industrial, (ex.:the ones for welding)</li>

     <li>domestic/household, (ex.: roomba)</li>

     <li>space, (ex:The Mars rover Curiosity) </li>
